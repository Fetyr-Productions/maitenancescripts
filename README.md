Some basic bash scripts for simple linux maitenance

So far only one script has been made.

This script creates a Documents, Music, Videos and Compressed folders in your ~/Downloads Directory.  It then searches through the ~/Downloads Directory (but only the Download, not any sub-directories) and sorts files into the corresponding folders based on file extension.

File types that are supported so far:
- doc
- docx
- pdf
- dot
- txt
- mp3
- m4a
- ogg
- wav
- mp4
- mov
- avi
- mkv
- rar
- tar*
- 7z
- zip

Feel free to take the script and add more files to it for your personal use.
